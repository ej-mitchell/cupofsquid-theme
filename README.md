# Cup of Squid Theme.

For my website: cupofsquid.com

This is adapted from the [Dawn theme](https://dawn.ghost.io) on Ghost.

## Motivations

I like color and whimsy. This theme was rather dull as is, which is great for
content-driven sites, but this is just my funsie site. Ideally no one cares for
my penchant for fun colors. 

Also I don't want anyone having to pay/sign up to read my stuff, so I ripped all 
that out too.
